## Key Objectives

   - Analyze how many restaurants offer online ordering and how this varies by location.
  
2. **Table Booking Options**: 
   - Explore the relationship between table booking availability, restaurant ratings, and popularity.

3. **Restaurant Ratings**: 
   - Visualize the distribution of restaurant ratings across the city and identify neighborhoods with the highest-rated restaurants.

4. **Customer Engagement**: 
   - Investigate the correlation between the number of votes (customer reviews) and overall restaurant ratings.

5. **Cuisine Types**: 
   - Discover the most popular cuisines across Bengaluru and how they vary by neighborhood.

6. **Cost Analysis**: 
   - Analyze the average cost for two people at restaurants by location and examine the relationship between cost, ratings, and popularity.

7. **Neighborhood Analysis**:

8. **Restaurant Types**: 
   - Compare different restaurant types (Quick Bites, Casual Dining, etc.) in terms of ratings and costs.

9. **Dishes Liked**:
